Our innovative Diabetic Prediction Model-DiabetaPro is a comprehensive and sophisticated tool that 
incorporates a range of key factors to provide a detailed assessment of an individual's risk of 
developing type 2 diabetes. Age, a fundamental risk factor, is integral to our model, with a substantial 
increase in diabetes risk noted after the age of 45. Furthermore, hypertension, or high blood pressure, 
is considered due to its role in contributing to insulin resistance and the impairment of blood vessels, 
resulting in challenges for the body to regulate blood sugar effectively. The intricate relationship 
between diabetes and heart disease is another critical aspect, as the presence of diabetes heightens the 
risk of heart disease, and reciprocally, heart disease intensifies the risk of complications in individuals 
with diabetes. Smoking history is another vital element incorporated into our model, as it 
significantly elevates the risk of type 2 diabetes and compounds the complexities of diabetes 
management.
Additionally, we consider the Body Mass Index (BMI) to assess the risk posed by obesity, especially 
when excess abdominal fat is present. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels provide valuable insights into 
an individual's long-term blood sugar control, with elevated levels indicating poorly managed 
diabetes, while lower levels are indicative of better control. We also consider blood glucose levels, 
which are a cornerstone of diabetes diagnosis and management, as consistently high blood sugar 
levels can signify both the presence of diabetes and challenges in its control. Recognizing the genderspecific nuances in diabetes risk, our model accommodates these variations, with a particular focus 
on women who have experienced gestational diabetes during pregnancy, who may face an increased 
risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. 
Futhermore, we acknowledge that the prevalence of diabetes can differ across genders in various 
populations. Our model offers a comprehensive and personalized approach to empower individuals 
with valuable insights into their diabetes risk, fostering informed decisions and proactive steps 
towards a healthier future.
